Although Ticker DQ had the highest return in 2017 of +199.4%, it had the lowest return in 2018 (-62.6%). This makes the stock very volatile and not a good investment for Stephen's parents. I recommend Stephen's parents diversify their stock and include ENPH because it had high growth in 2017 of + 129.5% and was one of the only two stock that grew in 2018 at +81.9%.
